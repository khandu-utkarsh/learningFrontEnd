# Understanding the Basics of React Framework  

This repository is dedicated to my journey of understanding the fundamental workings of the React framework.  

## About  

React is a JavaScript library that enables the creation of dynamic user interfaces by using JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript. JSX allows us to write code that closely resembles HTML, which is then used to define components. These components are rendered into the DOM to create a seamless user experience.  

## Key Learnings  

1. **JSX to React Elements**  
   React processes JSX code and transforms it into React elements.  

2. **Efficient DOM Updates**  
   React provides a mechanism to update the DOM efficiently without re-rendering the entire page.  

3. **Rendering Process**  
   - React first converts React elements into DOM nodes.  
   - It then updates or creates new DOM nodes as needed.  
   - Once all changes are prepared, React updates the DOM in a single operation.  

This approach ensures that the UI remains consistent and never appears broken during updates.
