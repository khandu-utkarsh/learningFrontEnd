Simple web application using open-meteo API to fecth the data.
Simply working, there is a home page, user will be asked for parameters for latitude and longitude (which should be in range.)
Once user click on submit button, navigate to the details page and show the relevant information.

2. User can directly navigate to the URL of details page, and it will fetch and show the correct data.
3. [TODO] Need to provide the page where we can show the the input params are out of range. 
4. [TODO] Fetch city, country, ocean, etc etc from the coordinates and display it.
5. [TODO] Asthetics of the website.
